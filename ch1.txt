Chapter 1

The tiger cat liked to go in and out of doors. It had a simple central processor,
that went something like this:

if out
  go in
else
  go out
fi

It couldn't tell time beyond, say, 15 seconds. Meaning that it forgot that it had
just gone in or out after about 15 seconds in its new environment.
