Chapter 2

One morning, while it was cold outside, it ran outside through the garage door entrance.

It probably had no idea as to why it went out. Well maybe it did. However if so, it only knew for a second,
if that given the cat's attention span. Is that really having an idea though? Or is it simply an idea passing through.
Interesting topic subject that, ideas. Do cats even have ideas? Considering they have no language to formulate those ideas,
their ideas must only be visualizations of actions. But if so, how much time do cats spend in reality? In the present?
