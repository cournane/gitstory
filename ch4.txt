Chapter 4

The tiger cat chose at the last possible moment to run back inside the
house, under the almost-closed garage door.

Being short, it didn't trigger the infrared beam at the bottom of the door that would
have indicated a collision.

The door closed on the cat, kinda squashing it to the cold ground.

Because it was cold, the cat started to freeze. Maybe that was a good thing? Because
the cat also relaxed, rather than injuring itself.
